If you have completed till lecture 12 by brushing up Java basic lectures,- You are good to start with Selenium.

Hungry on Learning Java in Depth??

If so then Jump to Section 25. There are lots of core java concepts with Practical examples and Interview questions are discussed.

But my  personal advice is to Continue with the lectures in order to complete Selenium first, and then learn java on your own pace :)
